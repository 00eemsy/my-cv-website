## 👩🏻‍💻 DESCRIPTION
Welcome to `grimterm 💀`, a text-based adventure game that merges the deathly with the corporate (and the nihilist)! In `grimterm`, you play as a grimterm (a grim-reaper-in-training/intern), going around collecting both souls and eulogies, exploring both the over- and underworld, fighting off evil soul snatchers, and praying for a promotion
