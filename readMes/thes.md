## 👩🏻‍🔬 DESCRIPTION
Welcome to my [Reed College senior research thesis](https://www.reed.edu/academics/thesis.html) ('25-'26) on HCI/accessible web UI/UX for older users (a.k.a. `thes`)!

## 🤔 FAQS
_💭: What is my thesis about?_
* Whether **different icon types** (text-only, icon-only, icons with text labels) have **positive performance effects** (speed, accuracy) for **older users** (60+ y/o) (versus younger users (18-35 y/o)
* Tested in real-life, **web-based task settings** instead of a sterile Qualtrics survey, adding an extra dimension of **realism**

_💭: Why choose to study age-based accessibility?_
* First and foremost, I'm what I like to call **"a technologist as a means-to-an-end"**, a.k.a, I develop for _people_, not just for performance optimization (which I still can do, but still). Therefore, choosing the field of **Human-Computer Interactions (HCI)** was a no-brainer-- after all, it's interdisciplinary, user-centered, and vast in scope!!!
* And as someone with a **background in frontend/full-stack** development, it was important for me to learn more about how to create REALLY good frontends.
* Which, of course, implies their accessibility.
* That got me thinking... **how can I help those around me**? And I immediately thought of my **grandparents**, scared of technology because of unfriendly, even malicious UIs.
* Oftentimes, **accessibility is boiled down** to helping users with specific disabilities (which is a valiant cause, of course!). But **older users are often factored out** of this equation, due to their mix of "disabilities" which come with age (vision, motility, hearing, etc.) and nonacknowledgement of said "disabilities".
* And thus, I narrowed my focus on accessible web UI/UX (which I have a Dev's background in) for older users (which includes some of my loved ones!).

## 📚 MY "TECH" STACK
Here's what I used to "deploy" my senior thesis: 
* `Figma` (for UI prototyping, creating user flows for Maze testing) ➡️ Find my designs [here](https://www.figma.com/design/NPirTZeYIWfw8ulIPyaSuq/THES?node-id=0-1&t=FIDbhARIE04f4RfA-1) ![]('./visuals/fig4thes.png')
* `Maze` (for running user study, data collection) ➡️ Demos/link coming soon...
* `Prolific` (for recruitment) ➡️ Demos/link coming soon...
* `Python3` (for data analysis) ➡️ Coming to repository soon...
* `Overleaf` (for LaTeX-ing my research paper/senior thesis) ➡️ Link to thesis paper coming soon...
