## 👩🏻‍💻 DESCRIPTION
Welcome to `stats and chats 📊`, a text-analysis and generative text program. This project comes in two parts: `stats.py` and `chats.py`.

`stats.py`: Takes a text and examines its contiguous runs of alphabet characters (or "words"). These "words" are analyzed and returned as a statistical report.
This report includes:
* The word count of the text file
* The number of distinct words
* The top _n_ words ranked by frequency, alongside the # of times they appear
* The number of words that occur exactly once

`chats.py`: Takes a text and analyzes it for "bi-grams" and "tri-grams"-- or strings of words that occur in 2s or 3s. A dictionary is then made for each word storing that words' bi-grams and tri-grams. Using this dictionary, a text is stochastically generated.
